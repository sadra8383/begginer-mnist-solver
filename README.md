# begginer-mnist-solver
program written with numpy to solve digit-recognition problem neural network

In order to run the main code you should copy mnist_loader to your python's lib folder and download data folder.You will probably need to readdress the location of the data folder. Data folder contains the mnist data which is going to be unwrapped by mnist loader.

I said this code is for begginers but you really should know how neural networks work in order to understand this code :P

I will answer any question contact me on 'sadrat83@gmail.com'

mnist loader is written by Michael Nielsen check out his book on how to make a neural network on 'http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html' I just optimized his program for python 3+
